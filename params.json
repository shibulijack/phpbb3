{"name":"phpBB - Visual Editor","body":" > phpBB 3 Development: phpBB is a popular open-source bulletin board written in PHP. I have integrated a Visual Editor into the phpbb core files.\r\n\r\nI am a big fan of phpBB. I have been using phpBB forums since I was 13. I am now currently using phpBB 3.0.10 “Olympus”. I love forums. phpBB, being the most popular bulletin board software, is my preferred choice for forums. Some of the novice users find it hard to work with the BBcode editor. I want to make the posting editor quicker and easier to use by including a rich JS based **WYSIWYG editor**, so that it also benefits everyone using phpBB, including myself.\r\n\r\nAlthough the current BBcode posting editor is good, it could be made much better and user-friendlier by having a JavaScript based Rich Text Editor. This would lead to quick posting even by novice users. My proposed project is to integrate a JavaScript Visual Editor like the **CKEditor** into the phpBB core. The intention is to improve the user experience while posting. Moreover, there should be an option in the UCP as well as in ACP to enable/disable Visual Editor, thereby allowing users to pick the editor that fits their needs.","tagline":"Creating communities","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
